# Digital Signature Algorithm Implementation
## Task:
 Create an application to create and verify a DSS digital signature.


## Requirements:
 - The software implementation must output the signature value for both the string specified in the input field and the file.
 - The result of the program should be displayed on the screen with the possibility of subsequent writing to a file.
 - In addition, the program must be able to verify the digital signature of any file on an existing signature file written in hexadecimal format.
 
 
## How to use:
 - [```ds.py```](https://github.com/nosoccus/information-security-technologies/blob/main/DSA/ds.py) - main file of the program.
 
Run ```ds.py``` and follow the instructions. The program will require to choose files for reading and writing.
